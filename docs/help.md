## Introduction <a id="introduction" />
Kitherder facilitates the running of a mentorship program by providing abilities to match together, mentor, mentee and project in a 1:1:1 relationship and to track the relationship from beginning to end. The system provides the following basic capabilities:

* Mentees can register for projects they are interested in or submit new projects
* Mentors can register for projects in which they are willing to mentor or to submit new projects
* Matches can be made so that mentor-mentee relationships can start and project work can begin
* Users can track progress on a project in order to show that mentees/mentors are giving the proper work time to a project and if not the project can be reassigned as needed.

In addition to the above capabilities, coordinators that manage the mentorship program can also perform manual matches for the mentor-mentee-project relationship for those belonging to their area, as well as make association between their division in Kitherder and the group they manage in Mozillian.
